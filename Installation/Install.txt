Before you read this I reccomend using Notepad++ or some things will look funny, or will paste wrong.
1st. Download the file, copy over the folder �Scripts� to your main RunUO folder.
(This adds the following: A item called a Mount Stone which can be added via [add MountStone, 
a mobile called �Mount� which can be also added via [add Mount. (DO NOT USE �Mount� in the real world, 
it�s like an unstable ethereal when not used with stone)

2nd. Back up your \Scripts\Mobiles\PlayerMobile.cs!! I will not be responsible for damages done to your shard.
(These edits make the mount disappear on dismount and beforedeath)

3rd. Add the following to your PlayerMobile.cs:
Find base.OnDoubleClick ( from ); 
Add before:
		//MountingStone
            if( this == from && (!DisableDismountInWarmode || !Warmode) )
            {
                IMount mount = Mount;
 
                if( mount != null )
                {
                    mount.Rider = null;
                    if (mount is Mount) ((Mount)mount).Delete(); // Or you can use Kill() instead of Delete() if you want a llama's corpse.
                    return;
                }
            }
 
            if( CanPaperdollBeOpenedBy( from ) )
                DisplayPaperdollTo( from );
		//MountingStone

Find: return base.OnBeforeDeath();
Add before:
			//MountingStone
			IMount mount = this.Mount;
			if (mount != null)
				mount.Rider = null;
			if (mount is Mount) ((Mobile)mount).Delete();
			//MountingStone
